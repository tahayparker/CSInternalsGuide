      3 marks; but this can change everything.



      It is a 5 - 10 minute interview with your teacher, where they will ask you
      questions about your project.



      It is important to know your project inside out, and to be able to explain
      it to someone who has never seen it before.



      You should be able to explain why you have imported a certain module and
      what role it plays in the project.



      Also go through Class XI Python theory, since this is often overlooked.



      If you've never opened your textbook from Class XII, now's a good time to
      do so.



      Read through the Python Revision Tours, the MySQL theory, and skim through
      networking.



      Questions depend on the teacher, but expect at least one question each
      from Python and MySQL. Networking is rarely asked, but there still is a
      chance.



      Usually you'll get 2 to 4 questions, depending on the external.



      **IF IN DOUBT OF AN ANSWER, INFROM THE EXTERNAL ABOUT THE SAME. SAYING "I
      DONT KNOW" DOES NOT REALLY CUT MARKS (unless the question is basic
      python.sql/something from your project). HOWEVER, CONFIDENTLY ANSWERING
      WRONGLY WILL DIG YOUR GRAVE AS THEY WILL KEEP BASING THE QUESTIONS OFF
      YOUR WRONG ANSWERS.**
