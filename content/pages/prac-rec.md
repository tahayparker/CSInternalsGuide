      A printed, binded document.


      Much much easier than the Project Record, considering it's just copy paste.

    title: The Record
    text: >+
      Your file should contain the following headers:

      
      * [Cover Page](#cover)
      
      
      * [Certificate](#certificate)
      
      
      * [Python programs (questions to be listed in index)](#python)
      
      
      * [MySQL programs](#mysql)
      
      
      Your file should have borders on all pages. The borders should be formal. Consider selecting solid or double borders, preferably in black.

      
      Your file should have page numbers on all pages. There is no rule regarding the format, but the preferred placement of the page number is either bottom centered or in the bottom right corner.


      Leave a margin on the left for the binding. You may go with narrow borders, and then press custom borders and add 0.5 to 1 cm to the margin on the left.


      Ensure that the page numbers are within the margins.

      There should be at least 20 to 25 Python programs in your practical record.


      These programs should be copy-pasted. NO SCREENSHOTS.


      Ensure that the programs are part of the portions.


      Ensure that the programs are numbered.


      The format for each question is as follows:


      * Experiment No. (number)
      
      
      * Aim: (insert aim here)
      
      
      * Code
          (insert code here)
      
      
      * Output
          (insert output here)
      
      
      Ensure that the code is in a monospace font (Courier New, Consolas, etc.)


      Use [Google Fonts] to find monospaced fonts.


      Try to run the program multiple times to fill the page. If the program has a menu, show the output of all the menus.

    title: Introduction
    text: >
      Write a brief introduction about your project.


      This is more of marketing than technical talk.


      Write about your project, and what it does, without going into the
      technical details at all.


      You can even "create" a problem and then propose your project as a
      solution to the problem.


      Do not exceed one page. Shouldn't get too boring.

      * User-defined functions - Any functions you have made yourself should be included here.

    title: Finalizing & Printing
    text: >+
      Once you are done with the first draft of the file, export it as a PDF and send it to your teacher for approval.


      Printing should be done preferably on 80 GSM paper. Size is compulsorily A4.


      <br>
      
      When sending for printing, please send the PDF. Using Word for printing will ruin the formatting.


      Use a good quality printer. The print should be clear and readable.


      If your parent's company has a printer, try asking if they can print. Otherwise, go to a stationery shop. Bargain as much as you can. Should be around 1 AED for 5 pages or so.


      Once you have printed the file, bind it. Spiral binding is the only binding accepted. Color should be as decided by your teacher.


      <br>

      All students MUST use the same color of binding.


      Once you have bound the file, you are done. Congratulations! Submit the file for final checks.


      While there shouldn't be any reason for the teacher to make corrections now (if the file was previously approved), it is still a good idea to get it checked once and correct any errors that may be pointed out.

    title: Tips
    text: >+
      Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write your project.

      It has syntax highlighting, themes, and auto-save functions among many others. Highly recommended.


      <br>
      
      Color your code. Use a light theme in Visual Studio Code and then copy paste the code into Word.


      The theme and the syntax highlighting will be copied as well. Looks nice, makes for a good first impression. Also "hides" errors because the examiner would be wow-ed by colors.
      
      
      I personally used [Kary Pro Colors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karyfoundation.theme-karyfoundation-themes) after messing around a bit with the theme files to change a few colors. But you could use it as it is, or get a different theme. Just make sure it's light.



      <br>

      Use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to help you write code. Helps save time.

      Free for students who have applied for the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) . You'll have to just prove that you're a student. Recommend using the school email to sign up, the approval is faster.


      <br>

      Use this [ANSI Character Generator](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/) to create cool looking titles that you can display when the program starts.

    title: Code Formatting Guidelines
    text: >+
      Format your Python code in the following format, so that it can be run on any computer with minimal to no changes to the code.


      ```

      import os


      import sys
      
      
      os.system("cls") OR os.system("clear") (ON MACS/LINUX ONLY)

      os.system("pip install #any other modules you used# ")

      sys.exit("Error installing modules!")
      
      
      try:

      ```
      
      `import os, sys` imports special modules that help connect with the terminal of your system.

      
      `os.system("cls")` / `os.system("clear")` clears the terminal so that all the messy input/output/errors on the screen are cleared off.

      
      `os.system` runs `pip` to install modules that you use so that you don't have to manually install them.

      
      Instead of `pip install`, you can use `pip3 install -qqq --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --no-color --no-warn-conflicts --user --no-python-version-warning --no-input --no-warn-script-location` to hide the installation process from the user.

      
      `sys.exit` exits the program if there is an error in the code.

      
      `cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS")` creates the tables from within Python itself, so you don't even have to see the MySQL terminal. Also ensures that the code works on any and every computer, provided the MySQL password is the same for all users.

      
      `cursor.execute("INSERT INTO")` inserts data into the table from within Python itself, so you don't even have to see the MySQL terminal. Also ensures that the code works on any and every computer, provided the MySQL password is the same for all users.
