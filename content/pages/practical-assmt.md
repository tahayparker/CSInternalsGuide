    title: Practical Assessment
    subtitle: 12 Marks
    text: "Practical Assessment is done in the Computer Lab, under the supervision of your teacher, the external examiner, and possibly external invigilators as well.\n\nThe Practical Assessment is the biggest part of your Internal Marks, as evidenced by the marking structure, accounting for 40% of your Internals.\n\nWhile \"sample\" papers / \"worksheets\" (if you know, you know ( ͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ) may be handed out before the exam (depends on the teacher), it is important to know what each line of code does, so that you can answer confidently if the external decides to go around and ask you.\n\nQuestions aren't certain; formats and types of questions may change, hence you must practice as much as possible.\n\nThe exam is easy, and nothing to stress about.\n\nThe answer sheet for the Practical Assessment is to be formatted as follows (subject to change, ask teacher for latest info):\n\n*   Exam Name (All India Senior...)\n\n*   Roll Number, Set Number\n\n*   Question Number (1A, 1B, etc.)\n\n*   Screenshot of code\n\n*   Screenshot of output\n\nThe batch of '23 did\_not\_have to write anything on paper as printer was provided for the exam, however, this may change.\n\nConsult your teacher for the most up-to-date info regarding this exam.\n\nPlease, for God's sake,\_**DO NOT ASK THE EXTERNALS FOR HELP.**\n\n**Asking externals gives them grounds to cut marks. If you have any doubts, wait for the externals to leave for their break and then ask your teacher, or if it is an emergency, quietly raise your hand to call the teacher to you.**\n"
