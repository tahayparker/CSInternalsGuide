      This is the only project that you will have to do in your entire year.


      The project must be written in Python and must use MySQL connectivity.


      The program must be a Menu-Driven Program.


      On the Python side, there should be at least 3 - 4 user-defined functions.


      On the MySQL side, there should be at least 2 tables. You should also use
      at least 4 MySQL functions, such as UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, SELECT, etc.




      There is no limit to what you can do in your project, however, you are
      limited to the usage of only Python and MySQL.


      This means you cannot integrate your project with other languages such as
      Flask.



      You are free to create as many user-defined functions as you want, and
      import as many modules you want.


      You may also create as many tables in MySQL as you see fit.




      Considering the restraints, most projects end up being variations of one
      another, but unique in their own way.


      Some broad categories include:


      *   Store-fronts (Movie store, Bookstore, etc.)


      *   Management (Inventory Management, Employee Management, etc.)


      *   Billing Systems (Electricity Billing, etc.)
