    title: The Project
    text: >+
      This is the only project that you will have to do in your entire year.


      The project must be written in Python and must use MySQL connectivity.


      The program must be a Menu-Driven Program.


      On the Python side, there should be at least 3 - 4 user-defined functions.


      On the MySQL side, there should be at least 2 tables. You should also use
      at least 4 MySQL functions, such as UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, SELECT, etc.




      There is no limit to what you can do in your project, however, you are
      limited to the usage of only Python and MySQL.


      This means you cannot integrate your project with other languages such as
      Flask.



      You are free to create as many user-defined functions as you want, and
      import as many modules you want.


      You may also create as many tables in MySQL as you see fit.




      Considering the restraints, most projects end up being variations of one
      another, but unique in their own way.


      Some broad categories include:


      *   Store-fronts (Movie store, Bookstore, etc.)


      *   Management (Inventory Management, Employee Management, etc.)


      *   Billing Systems (Electricity Billing, etc.)

    title: The File / Record
    text: >
      Your file should contain the following headers:

      * [Cover Page](#cover)


      * [Certificate](#certificate)


      * [Acknowledgement](#acknowledgement)


      * [Introduction](#intro)


      * [Synopsis](#synopsis)


      * [System Description](#sysdesc)


      * [Program Source Code](#sourcecode)


      * [Program Output](#output)


      * [Conclusion](#conclusion)


      * [Bibliography](#bibliography)


      <br>

      These will be explained in detail in the following sections.


      Your file should have borders on all pages. The borders should be formal.
      Consider selecting solid or double borders, preferably in black.


      Your file should have page numbers on all pages. There is no rule
      regarding the format, but the preferred placement of the page number is
      either bottom centered or in the bottom right corner.


      Leave a margin on the left for the binding. You may go with narrow
      borders, and then press custom borders and add 0.5 to 1 cm to the margin
      on the left.


      Ensure that the page numbers are within the margins.

      Pretty straighforward, nothing to worry about.


      Write a page thanking your teacher, your parents, your friends, and anyone
      else who helped you.


      Or copy-paste, yknow. Or just use GPT. Pretty helpful. Should be about
      half a page long.


      *Pro Tip: [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) writes stuff pretty naturally if
      you tell it to. [Contact me](https://tahayparker.vercel.app/contact/) if
      you want the prompt I use.*


      Do not exceed one page. Seriously. No need to thank every single person.

    title: Introduction

      Write a brief introduction about your project.


      This is more of marketing than technical talk.


      Write about your project, and what it does, without going into the
      technical details at all.


      You can even "create" a problem and then propose your project as a
      solution to the problem.


      Do not exceed one page. Shouldn't get too boring.

      * User-defined functions - Any functions you have made yourself should be included here.

    title: Finalizing & Printing
    text: >+
      Once you are done with the first draft of the file, export it as a PDF and send it to your teacher for approval.


      Printing should be done preferably on 80 GSM paper. Size is compulsorily A4.


      <br>
      
      When sending for printing, please send the PDF. Using Word for printing will ruin the formatting.


      Use a good quality printer. The print should be clear and readable.


      If your parent's company has a printer, try asking if they can print. Otherwise, go to a stationery shop. Bargain as much as you can. Should be around 1 AED for 5 pages or so.


      Once you have printed the file, bind it. Spiral binding is the only binding accepted. Color should be as decided by your teacher.


      <br>

      All students MUST use the same color of binding.


      Once you have bound the file, you are done. Congratulations! Submit the file for final checks.


      While there shouldn't be any reason for the teacher to make corrections now (if the file was previously approved), it is still a good idea to get it checked once and correct any errors that may be pointed out.
